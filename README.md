# weather-app-journal
submission of the weather app project for udacity

**for this project I used the starter code files from Udacity

* I created the server side code in vanilla javascript to allow the server to store and retrieve the data in cooperation with the client side
* used node.js and express and used body-parser and CORS as middlewares
*for the client side I used the Openweathermap API and its key to get accurate weather data 
* the user is supposed to provide some data such as the zip code and his feelings for the client side to get the temperature from the API and then send it to the server side to store it
*and finally the client side get the data from the server to use it to change the interface according to the provided data
